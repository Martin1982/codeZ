# codeZ - In browser coding tool #

codeZ is a package that makes it possible to code in the cloud. At the moment the software is still in pre-alpha stage and totally unuseable. As soon as the main functionality has been implemented an alpha release will be packaged.

Even though codeZ makes use of a lot of packages via Bower there is still a lot of work, if you support this idea and you'd like to get it up and running faster feel free to fork and send in those pull requests.
